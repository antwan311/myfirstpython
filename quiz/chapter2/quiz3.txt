10- Evaluate 2 ** 3 ** 2 and (2 ** 3) ** 2 note the difference. ( if confuse about exponent - see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwNmYDNhRqc)
the diffirence is that the producto for 2** 3 ** 2 is bigger because it does all of the equations and then it adds them all up
but (2 ** 3) ** 2 does one at a time so its smaller.
